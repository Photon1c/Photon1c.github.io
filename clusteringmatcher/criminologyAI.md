The [murder accountability](https://www.murderdata.org/) project is a great starting point to follow along the aims of this project.

"Matches" and "links" are terms that are explained at length in this [document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y64rwudo5gds94z/MAP_Link_Match.pdf?dl=1) from the murder accountability project.

Given a starting database with cleaned data to preprocess as an input, match a set of subparameters across a suite of different predictive-analytical functions. Examples of subparameters may  include:

>Victim profiles
>Body disposition
>Mortality mechanisms
>Modus Operandi
>Other Patterns

Methods like cluster analysis have been used to identify serial homicide patterns, but how can these be accelerated?
