Built a Stock Seismograph Monitoring System using GARCH models and critical rupture detection to forecast volatility breakouts and stock oscillation patterns.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Designed Python-based financial modeling tools to forecast option volatility and price breakouts using GARCH, ATR, and Donchian Channels over historical datasets.

---

## 2. 🛠 Modular Python Engineering
**Project Example:**  
Split `stream_ear_bowr.py` into config-managed modules (transcription, keyword scanning, report generation), with a reusable `settings.json`.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Engineered modular Python pipelines with centralized config management for live audio processing, keyword extraction, and data logging.

---

## 3. 📡 Real-Time Stream Processing & Transcription
**Project Example:**  
Created a live YouTube stream listener (Bowr) that records 30-second segments every 15 minutes, uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription, and triggers alerts on keyword matches.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Developed an automated stream listener app using Streamlink and OpenAI Whisper for keyword detection in live news broadcasts.

---

## 4. 📈 Financial Dashboard & UI Development (Flask + Plotly)
**Project Example:**  
Built the **Alpha Cockpit** dashboard with a status panel, seed radar UI, chirp alerts, and customizable gauges for option premium analysis.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Built Flask dashboards to visualize real-time market signals, historical trends, and AI-triggered sentiment alerts using Plotly and HTML/CSS.

---

## 5. 🎯 Option Pricing with Real-World Analogies
**Project Example:**  
Designed a Black-Scholes rocket simulator to illustrate option premium thrust and decay using physics metaphors and 4D time visualization.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Designed creative simulations to model option pricing mechanics using physics-inspired analogies and 4D forecasting engines.

---

## 6. 🧠 Agent-Based Simulation (Biology & Behavior Modeling)
**Project Example:**  
Simulated immune system behavior in Three.js with dynamic white blood cells, T-cells, CXCL10 signaling, and tumor interactions.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Programmed agent-based simulations to visualize immune response dynamics and cancer detection behaviors using Three.js and biologically-informed logic.

---

## 7. 📁 Workflow Optimization and Legal Tech Automation
**Project Example:**  
Explored stealth conflict checkers for legal case management, analyzing Outlook email logs, matching aliases, and optimizing referral flows.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Prototyped legal workflow automations for conflict checks, time mapping, and task differentiation in constraint-laden enterprise environments.

---

## 8. 🔍 Natural Language Processing & Keyword Mapping
**Project Example:**  
Developed `twigs.py` and `news_nest.py` to cluster related news articles around detected seed keywords, cross-referenced via fuzzy logic.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Built NLP keyword classifiers and clustering logic for event detection and news aggregation across streaming transcripts and RSS feeds.

---

## 9. 🌐 Cross-Platform Integration (YouTube, APIs, CSVs, JSON)
**Project Example:**  
Integrated OpenAI APIs, Streamlink, and structured `.json`/`.csv` pipelines across multiple devices and platforms.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Integrated REST APIs, local data pipelines, and stream interfaces to maintain cross-platform operability across cloud, browser, and local systems.

---

## 10. 🎨 Creative Technical Storytelling
**Project Example:**  
Projects like **Dermasim**, **Alpha Cockpit Seed Radar**, and **Naked Trader Defense System** blend humor, finance, and real analytics.

**📌 Resume Bullet:**  
> Crafted engaging technical applications blending humor, finance, and visual metaphors to simplify complex concepts for broader accessibility.
